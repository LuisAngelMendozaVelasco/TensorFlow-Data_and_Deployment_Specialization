# Iris Classifier

In the next example, we will create a neural network that can classify the 3 types of Iris plants found in the Iris dataset. You can use Brackets to open the **C1_W1_Lab_2_iris_classifier.html** file and take a look at the code. You can find the **C1_W1_Lab_2_iris_classifier.html** file in the following folder in the GitHub repository for this course:

https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W1/ungraded_labs

When you launch the **C1_W1_Lab_2_iris_classifier.html** file in the Chrome browser (using the Web Server) make sure to open the Developer Tools to see the output in the Console. After training has finished, the code will alert the name of the predicted Iris plant. As you can see below, in this particular example, the predicted Iris plant is a Setosa.
