# Your First Model

We are going to start by taking a look at a simple example. You can use Brackets to open the **C1_W1_Lab_1_FirstHTML.html** file and take a look at the code. You can find the C1_W1_Lab_1_FirstHTML.html file in the following folder in the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W1/ungraded_labs

When you launch the **C1_W1_Lab_1_FirstHTML.html** file in the Chrome browser make sure to open the Developer Tools to see the training progress.
