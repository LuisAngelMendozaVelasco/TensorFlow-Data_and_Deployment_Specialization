# Linear Model

In the next example, we will train a linear model in Python and then convert it into JSON format using the TensorFlow.js converter.

Open the **C1_W3_Lab_3A_linear_to_JavaScript.ipynb** Jupyter notebook found in the following folder in the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W3/ungraded_labs

To run this notebook you will need have installed Jupyter with Python 3, TensorFlow 2.0, Tensorflow.js, and NumPy.

After you run the Jupyter Notebook, you will end up with a single JSON file named **model.json** and a **.bin** file named group1-shard1of1.bin (you can also find these files in the above folder of the GitHub repository). 

After you have the **model.json** and the **group1-shard1of1.bin** files, you can launch the **C1_W3_Lab_3B_linear.html** file in the Chrome browser. Don't forget to open the Developer Tools to see the output in the Console.
