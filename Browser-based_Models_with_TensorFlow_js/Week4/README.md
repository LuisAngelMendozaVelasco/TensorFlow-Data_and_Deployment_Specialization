# Transfer Learning with Pre-Trained Models

One final work type that you'll need when creating Machine Learned applications in the browser is to understand how transfer learning works. This week you'll build a complete web site that uses TensorFlow.js, capturing data from the web cam, and re-training mobilenet to recognize Rock, Paper and Scissors gestures.

## Learning Objectives

- Train a model in your web browser by using images captured via a webcam
- Apply transfer learning to train a model to recognize hand gestures of rock, paper, and scissors
- Apply transfer learning to train a model to recognize hand gestures of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock
