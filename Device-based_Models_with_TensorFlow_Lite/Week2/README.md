# Running a TF model in an Android App

Last week you learned about TensorFlow Lite and you saw how to convert your models from TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite format. You also learned about the standalone TensorFlow Lite Interpreter which could be used to test these models. You wrapped with an exercise that converted a Fashion MNIST based model to TensorFlow Lite and then tested it with the interpreter. This week you'll look at the first of the deployment types for this course: Android. Android is a versatile operating system that is used in a number of different device type, but most commonly phones, tablets and TV systems. Using TensorFlow Lite you can run your models on Android, so you can bring ML to any of these device types. While it helps to understand some Android programming concepts, we hope that you'll be able to follow along even if you don't, and at the very least try out the full sample apps that we'll explore for Image Classification, Object Detection and more!

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how incorporate a TF Lite model into Android apps
- Create an Android app that performs image classification
- Create an Android app that performs object detection
