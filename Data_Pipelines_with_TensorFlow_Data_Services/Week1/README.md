# Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services

This week, you will be able to perform efficient ETL tasks using Tensorflow Data Services APIs

## Learning Objectives

- Work with familiar datasets like MNIST, Horses or Humans and Rock, Paper and Scissors, and execute extract and transform tasks by loading and batching these built-in TensorFlow Datasets
- Analyze the metadata and information of each dataset
- Create a streamlined pipeline for model training
- Reinforce your knowledge of TensorFlow Data Services API with the practice quiz
- Apply your data pipeline building skills in the assignment by creating a complete ETL pipeline using the TFDS API, and defining a simple CNN model which can be trained later on
