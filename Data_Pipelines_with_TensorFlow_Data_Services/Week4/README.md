# Performance

You'll learn how to handle your data input to avoid bottlenecks, race conditions and more!

## Learning Objectives

- Identify bottlenecks in your input pipelines
- Improve your pipelines impacting your model training
- Learn about caching and parallelizing your inputs
- Develop your intuition towards using best practices with the first quiz to identify bottlenecks in input and training pipelines and to mitigate them using caching and parallelization.
- Parallelize various stages of the Extract, Transform and Load processes in the assignment by caching and prefetching instead of just naively loading the data from cats vs dogs dataset to build an optimized training pipeline
- [Optional] Publish and share your own datasets using TensorFlow Hub
- [Optional] Dive deeper into the DatasetBuilder class with the second quiz, which has some nifty features for configuring and creating your custom dataset read to be published to TensorFlow Hub
